/**
 * An implementation of the Jena datastore on Cassandra.
 *
 * This implementation uses 4 tables.  All 4 tables are written to on insert and delete.
 * When querying a single table is used based on the columns provided in the query.
 *
 * Graph patterns
 * <ul>
 * <li>SPOG</li>
 * <li>POGS</li>
 * <li>OSGP</li>
 * <li>GSPO</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The mapping of query columns to table is performed in the CassandraConnection class.
 *
 * <p>
 * All tables have the same structure with different primary key definition.  All primary keys are
 * multi-segmented with the first segment being the partition key.  The column order in the primary key
 * match the column names from the table name. (e.g. SPOG has the primary key = subject, predicate, object,
 * graph).
